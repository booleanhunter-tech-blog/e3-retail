### Common commands

#### Creating an index

`npm run create-index your-index-name`

#### Bulk uploading Data

Syntax for uploading data in `.ndjson` format:

```
curl -XPOST -u 'username:password' 'your-elasticsearch-url/_bulk' --data-binary @datasets/flipkart-products-bulk.ndjson -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

#### Working on templates

Templates inside the `views` directory can be used for both server-side as well as client-side rendering, with the help of Handlebars. Once you make changes to the templates inside the `views` directory, run `npm run create-templates` to compile them for client-side usage.
